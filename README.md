# BaseConvertor

## What is it ? ðŸ¤”

BaseConvertor is a simple Python tool to convert numbers from various numeral systems to base 10 and reciprocally.

## How can I use it ? ðŸ“ˆ

Currently, you can use it with the function-defining file itself - I didn't implement a UI for now.

Two restrictions too : numeral systems bases are only integers, and those integers are bounded between 1 and 36.\
Those restrictions rely on the lack of a conventional written representation over base 36 (0-9 and A-Z are used) and in non-integer or non-positive bases.
